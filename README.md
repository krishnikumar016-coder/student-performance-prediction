# Student Academic Performance Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts student academic performance using data science and machine learning techniques. 
The goal is to identify students at academic risk at an early stage to support timely intervention.

## Dataset
The dataset contains student demographic, academic, and behavioral attributes such as:
- Attendance
- Study time
- Previous grades (G1, G2)
- Family and social factors

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering (Pass/Fail and Low/Medium/High categorization)
- Logistic Regression model
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics

## Results
- The model achieved good accuracy in predicting student performance.
- Visualization of student performance levels provides clear insights into academic trends.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of data science techniques for educational analytics and early performance prediction.
